What is pyny3d?
---------------

*pyny3d* is a Python3 *tyny* 3D tool for easily and interactively build
and generate information from simple and very light geometry models based
on polygons. It is possible to perform solar shadowing simulations and 
timeseries data projections (radiation, for example) over these models.

.. figure:: ../images/cover.png
   :scale: 90%
   :align: center
   
   *Projected radiation about a column during a year. The square in cyan 
   indicated the contact between the column and the floor (this area has not 
   been simulated)*

It is an important part of the `Solarized Project <link>`__, which main goal
is to find the perfect mix between Integrated Solar Energy Recursive
Computations and Artificial Intelligence guidance. `pyny3d` was created in
this context, not to be a cutting edge library on functionality or 
performance, but to be as simple and intuitive as possible without refusing
to contain a reasonable set of helpful features.


Finally, if you want to see this tool in action addressing different kind of 
problems visit the :ref:`tutorials` section. You will find there easy code, 
explanatory visualizations and concise explanations about what is happening and
why.
